//! Fixed topology implementation for static peer lists.
//!
//! This module provides a built-in fixed/static topology discovery mechanism:
//! - [`FixedTopology`] - A topology with statically configured peers
//!
//! This is a core/built-in feature (not a plugin) and is useful for:
//! - Development and testing environments
//! - Small deployments with known, static peer configurations
//! - Environments where service discovery is not available
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! Fixed topology is configured using the predefined type format:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [topology]
//! provider = "fixed"
//!
//! [topology.fixed]
//! peers = [
//!     { address = "192.168.1.10", port = 9090, locality = "SameRegion" },
//!     { address = "192.168.1.11", port = 9090, locality = "OtherRegion" },
//! ]
//! ```
