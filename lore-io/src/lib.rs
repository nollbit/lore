//! Completion-based asynchronous file I/O.
//!
//! This crate provides positional file operations whose futures are
//! runtime-independent: they suspend on wakers only and never require a
//! specific async runtime to be driving them. The memory an operation
//! exposes to the kernel belongs to the operation for its whole lifetime —
//! a write takes ownership of the caller's buffer and hands it back, and a
//! read allocates its own and returns it as [`bytes::Bytes`]. That is the
//! contract completion-based backends (`io_uring`, overlapped I/O) require,
//! where the kernel holds a pointer into the buffer while an operation is
//! in flight and an abandoned future must not free it.
//!
//! Backends are selected once and dispatched statically:
//!
//! - `psync` — positional syscalls executed on a dedicated bounded syscall
//!   pool (`min(2 × cores, 16)` threads, idle-reaped). The portable
//!   baseline backend and the semantic reference for all others.
//! - `uring` (Linux 5.6+) — data-plane operations submitted to sharded
//!   `io_uring` instances; synchronously-completing operations resolve on
//!   the submitting thread, pending ones through a single reaper thread.
//!   Control-plane operations run on the syscall pool.
//! - `iocp` (Windows) — positional reads and writes issued as overlapped
//!   I/O against one completion port, on the calling thread; operations the
//!   kernel finishes during the issuing call never reach the port, and the
//!   rest are completed by a single reaper. Control-plane operations run on
//!   the syscall pool.
