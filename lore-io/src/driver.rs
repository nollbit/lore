//! Driver construction and backend dispatch.
//!
//! The backend surface is the set of operations [`DriverInner`]'s match arms call: `open`,
//! `read_at`, `read_exact_at`, `read_vectored_at`, `write_at`, `write_all_at`,
//! `write_vectored_at`, `open_read_head`, `read_file_bytes`, `write_file_bytes`,
//! `write_file_segments`, `write_file_segments_atomic`, `sync`, `metadata`, `file_metadata`,
//! `holds_name_exactly`, `set_len`, `rename`, `copy`, `remove_file`, `create_dir_all`, `remove_dir`
//! and `remove_dir_all`. A backend implements all twenty-three as inherent methods on its own
//! type.
//!
//! Every operation dispatches, including the metadata ones a completion backend will keep on the
//! syscall pool anyway — a ring-submitted `statx` is punted to a kernel worker making the same
//! blocking call, so it buys no parallelism. Routing them anyway is what makes a backend able to
//! override any operation and a driver instance self-contained, rather than partly bypassed. It
//! also leaves [`crate::pool`] reachable only from the backends.
//!
//! There is no trait, and none is needed to make that complete: adding a variant to
//! [`DriverInner`] makes every match here non-exhaustive, and filling those arms in requires
//! each operation to exist with a compatible signature, so a backend cannot be half-wired. What
//! a trait would add over that is a single place to read the surface and a bar on signatures
//! drifting between backends — worth revisiting when there is a second one to compare against.
//!
//! Dispatch is static. The enum holds backend values rather than trait objects, so each arm
//! binds a concrete type and the call inlines as any inherent method would; no vtable exists on
//! this path.
//!
//! What the arms cannot check is behaviour, which is what `tests/conformance.rs` is for: adding a
//! backend to its `drivers()` list runs every case against it.
