//! Overlapped I/O on an I/O completion port: the Windows completion backend.
//!
//! Positional reads and writes are issued on the calling thread as overlapped operations against
//! one completion port, and finished by a reaper thread draining it. Everything else — open, stat,
//! sync, directory operations, the whole-file composites — runs on the syscall pool, because
//! Windows offers no overlapped form of those calls.
//!
//! This is not [`crate::overlapped`], which is the blocking shim `psync` uses on this platform.
//! Both issue an `OVERLAPPED` this crate owns; the difference is only what happens after the
//! submission, a wait on a pool thread there and a completion port here.
//!
//! **A buffered read on an overlapped handle defers.** `ReadFile` reports `ERROR_IO_PENDING`
//! rather than transferring, so an operation costs a syscall on the calling thread and a packet on
//! the port, and no thread is held across the device round trip. That is what this backend is for:
//! the same read through `psync` parks a pool thread until the kernel is done, which makes the
//! pool size a ceiling on how many reads can be in flight. Two threads here against a saturated
//! thirty-two there, at 1.76× and 4.80× the throughput on the synthetic read phases —
//! `lore-io/BENCHMARKS.md` has the figures, and the workload where the trade goes the other way.
//!
//! **Inline completions never reach the port.** `FILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS` is a
//! correctness requirement rather than the optimisation it looks like: without it an operation the
//! kernel finishes during the call both returns `TRUE` and queues a packet, so the submitting
//! thread would complete it and the reaper would complete it again — a double free of the entry.
//! [`IocpDriver::register`] therefore fails an open that cannot set it.
//! `FILE_SKIP_SET_EVENT_ON_HANDLE` comes with it, because nothing here waits on the file handle's
//! event, and leaving the I/O manager to signal it would make the handle a write-shared cache line
//! between concurrent operations — the sharing this API exists to allow.
//!
//! **One port and one reaper.** A ring serializes submissions under a per-ring lock, which is why
//! [`crate::uring`] shards; a completion port has no such lock and is built for many threads on
//! both sides. On the completion side the reaper count is [`REAPERS`], and one is not a placeholder.
//!
//! Buffer ownership is the ring's contract unchanged: the operation entry owns the buffer and the
//! file handle for the kernel's whole view of the operation, an abandoned future marks the entry
//! rather than freeing anything, and the `OVERLAPPED` the kernel writes into lives in that entry.
