//! What a scan of an unchanged tree costs in allocations, per file.
//!
//! Reports rather than asserts: the number is a measurement to compare across changes, and
//! a threshold would either be loose enough to catch nothing or tight enough to break on an
//! unrelated allocation somewhere else in the process.
//!
//! Counting needs a glibc interposer preloaded and the system allocator selected, since the
//! default rpmalloc takes its pages from `mmap` and never reaches `malloc`:
//!
//! ```text
//! gcc -shared -fPIC -O2 -o /tmp/libcount.so scripts/allocations/allocount.c
//! LORE_ALLOCATOR=system LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/libcount.so LORE_SCAN_FILES=2000 \
//!     cargo test --test path_allocations -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! These report rather than assert, so they are ignored by default and asked for by name:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo nextest run -p lore-revision --run-ignored all -E 'test(reports_its_allocations)'
//! ```
//!
//! They stay compiled by every build, which is what catches a platform they no longer build
//! on. Without the interposer the counts read as absent and the walk still runs.
