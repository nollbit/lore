/// Both bounds over every construct the compiler can hand the index.
///
/// The upper bound is the one that has to be an over-estimate: it decides
/// whether a rule is dropped from an answer, and a bound that is too small
/// drops content with nothing downstream able to tell. It is checked beside
/// the lower one, since a pair that crossed would describe a rule able to
/// match at no depth at all.
///
/// The compiled glob is asserted too, because the bounds read the compiled
/// text rather than the authored rule, and the interesting rows differ in
/// how `compile` treats them: a leading separator is what decides whether
/// `*` is a name rule or a path one, and `**/a/b` keeps a prefix that
/// `**/name` loses.
