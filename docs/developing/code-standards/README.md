# Code standards

Coding conventions governing how Lore source is written.

## What this folder is

Per-language, per-area conventions for error handling, logging, task spawning, testing, comments, and similar concerns. Each page is a Code-Standard doc — imperative rules paired with rationale, code examples, and reference tables.

## The standards

- [Engineering principles](engineering-principles.md). The values every rule in this folder follows from: performance, correctness by construction, simplicity, determinism, fault isolation, and observability.
- [Error handling](errors.md). Discrete `#[ffi_code]` types, per-module `#[error_set]` enums, forwarding between sets, FFI code allocation, and the no-`unwrap` rule.
- [Logging](logging.md). `tracing` for server and tool code, Lore macros for library code, and when to use each log level.
- [Task spawning](tasks.md). The `lore_spawn!` macros that keep `LORE_CONTEXT` propagating across async and blocking tasks.
- [Async futures](async-futures.md). What a future holds across its awaits, when to box, how to spawn, and how future sizes are tested and measured.
- [Testing](testing.md). Unit tests in each crate's `tests/unit/`, the `test-util` feature for what they cannot reach, async and smoke test patterns, and the test-independence rules that keep them isolated.
- [Comments and documentation](comments.md). Rust doc-comment expectations and when a code comment earns its place.
- [Code review](code-review.md). How to review a change: the guidance to review against, irreversible changes to escalate, and performance issues to look for.
