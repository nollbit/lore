//! Temporary directories and files for the tests.
//!
//! [`TempDir`], and [`TempFile`] for a single file, are the only way a test asks
//! for scratch space on disk. Names carry a random suffix, so a test is isolated
//! from every other test and from a second run on the same machine, and removal
//! happens in `Drop`, so it happens whether the test passes, fails an assertion,
//! or returns early.
//!
//! Hand-building a path under [`std::env::temp_dir`] gives up both of those, and
//! removing a directory on the last line of a test body gives up the second: a
//! failing assertion panics before reaching that line.
//!
//! `LORE_KEEP_TEST_DATA=1` keeps them instead of removing them. The prefix is
//! all there is to go on when picking one out afterwards, so make it name the
//! test where several in a module would otherwise share one.
//!
//! Behind the `test-util` feature, which the crates whose tests need it enable
//! from their dev-dependencies, so none of this reaches a normal build.
