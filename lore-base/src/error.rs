//! Consolidated FFI error types for the Lore system.
//!
//! All discrete error types with FFI codes are defined here,
//! providing a single source of truth for FFI error code allocation.
//! This is the base error crate with no dependency on lore-storage.
//!
//! # Code allocation
//!
//! Codes are grouped into blocks by the kind of failure they report, so a
//! consumer can branch on a range when it only cares about the category and on
//! the exact value when it cares about the specific error.
//!
//! Every code is also a process exit status: the CLI returns the failing
//! error's code from `main` as `ExitCode::from(code as u8)`. That fixes two
//! things. Every code must fit in a `u8`, and no code may land on a value the
//! shell or the OS already spends on something else — a `lore` command that
//! exited 130 would be indistinguishable from one the user killed with Ctrl-C.
//! The reserved rows below are those values, and no group block overlaps one.
//!
//! | Range | Group | Meaning |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | 0 | *reserved* | Success. |
//! | 1 | *reserved* | The CLI's own general failure (`ExitCode::FAILURE`), and the shell's generic error. |
//! | 2 | *reserved* | The CLI's usage exit, and the shell's "misuse of a builtin". |
//! | 3–15 | Input and validation | The request itself was malformed or names the wrong kind of thing. |
//! | 16–27 | Authentication and authorization | The caller is not known, or is known and not permitted. |
//! | 28–39 | Connectivity and availability | The remote could not be reached or is not currently serving. |
//! | 40–55 | Repository state | The repository is in a state that refuses the operation. |
//! | 56–63 | Already exists | Creating a resource that is already there. |
//! | 64–78 | *reserved* | The BSD `sysexits.h` codes (`EX_USAGE` through `EX_CONFIG`). |
//! | 79–99 | Not found | A named resource does not exist. |
//! | 100–109 | *reserved* | The legacy `LoreError` categories (101, 102, 103). |
//! | 110–117 | Configuration | Something the operation needs was never configured. |
//! | 118–125 | Resource limits | A size, depth, or efficiency bound was hit. |
//! | 126–128 | *reserved* | The shell's "found but not executable", "not found", and "bad argument to exit". |
//! | 129–192 | *reserved* | `128 + signal`, i.e. killed by a signal. 130 is Ctrl-C, 137 is `SIGKILL`, 143 is `SIGTERM`. |
//! | 193–200 | Library lifecycle | The library cannot serve the call. |
//! | 201–254 | *reserved* | Free for future groups. |
//! | 255 | *reserved* | `Internal`, which is `-1` truncated to a `u8`. |
//!
//! The trait carries a code as `i32` rather than a `u8` because `Internal` is
//! `-1`, which is not a code allocated here.
//!
//! Add a new error to the block that matches its group and take the next free
//! code in that block. Never renumber an existing code to close a gap: the gaps
//! are the headroom that keeps a group contiguous, and the tests below hold
//! every block clear of the reserved values so anything taken from that
//! headroom is a usable exit status. New groups come out of 201–254. A type
//! whose name ends in `NotFound` belongs in the not-found block even when it
//! also belongs to a subsystem that has its own errors elsewhere —
//! `PluginNotFound` sits with the other not-found codes, not with the other
//! plugin codes.
