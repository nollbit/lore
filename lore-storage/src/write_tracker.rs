//! Per-operation tracker for background fragment-write tasks.
//!
//! A `WriteTracker` collects leader and follower tasks produced during a
//! commit-like operation. Every spawned task self-reports its result into
//! shared atomic/lock state when it finishes, so nothing accumulates
//! per-task in the tracker — memory stays O(in-flight) regardless of total
//! spawns. Leaders and followers use the same dispatch machinery; the names
//! reflect the caller's role (leader owns the permit/buffer, follower
//! shadows an existing in-flight leader) and carry no tracker-level
//! difference.
