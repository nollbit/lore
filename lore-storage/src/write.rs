/// A chunk that no longer matches returns [`FileMatch::Differs`] immediately, and a walk
/// that cannot proceed at all — a sublist that fails to load or is not a list — returns
/// [`FileMatch::Indeterminate`]. A list that merely misdescribes the content reads as a
/// difference rather than as indeterminate, since the list is what defines the ranges being
/// hashed: wrong offsets simply hash the wrong bytes.

/// chunk stopped exactly at the mismatch — the cost of not paying a round trip per chunk on
