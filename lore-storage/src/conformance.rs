//! The contract every [`ImmutableStore`] owes its callers, as an executable battery.
//!
//! A caller reaching a store through `Arc<dyn ImmutableStore>` cannot see which implementation it
//! has, so the guarantees must not depend on that. They currently do: the same question asked of
//! two stores, or of one store through two of its methods, can come back differently. This module
//! is where those guarantees are stated once and checked against every implementation, rather than
//! restated in each store's own tests in each store's own words.
//!
//! It is deliberately not `#[cfg(test)]`. The implementations live in several crates, and a store
//! reached over a wire is only assemblable where a server is; each store calls
//! [`verify_immutable_store`] from a test of its own, with the construction that crate already
//! uses.
//!
//! The clauses, as written into the trait:
//!
//! 1. **Never over-report.** A reported level must hold: the association it names exists. Whether
//!    the payload can be served from here is `stored_local` and `stored_durable`, not the level — a
//!    store may hold the representation alone and still report a full match.
//! 2. **May under-report.** A store may answer with a weaker level than the truth when establishing
//!    the stronger one costs more than it is worth. This is why the assertions below are bounds —
//!    `<= MatchPartition`, never `== MatchPartition`.
//! 3. **Obliterated never matches**, through any method.
//! 4. **Reads do not under-serve, and agree with each other.** `get` serves everything within the
//!    store's read scope and `get_metadata` describes whatever `get` would serve. `query` reaches
//!    further, to the store's query scope, because a level is something to act on with another
//!    operation rather than bytes owed here.
//! 5. **A match names where it was found, and prefers where it was asked.** Another partition is
//!    named only when the one asked about holds nothing. The context may be left unnamed, but a
//!    named one is an association `copy` will read from.
//!
//! # Known violations
//!
//! Not every store passes today. A store declares the checks it is known to fail via
//! [`Capabilities::known_violations`], and the battery then *requires* those to fail: a defect that
//! gets fixed without being delisted fails the test just as loudly as a new one. Nothing is
//! silently skipped, and the list is the work queue.
